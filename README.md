# aeiou
Aeiou is a Discord bot meant for funposting. We've intentionally left out the host of moderation features other bots have in order to add things that make being on a server more fun, such as custom reacts or plants.

# How to install?
Be sure to have a localhost:3306 MySQL server running. Remove the `.template` from secure.template.json and settings.template.sqlite3. Lastly, fill in secure.json with your actual values.

# How can I contribute? 
Feel free to submit a pull request! Aeiou is always in active development and any help is greatly appreciated.

# How can I invite aeiou to my server?
