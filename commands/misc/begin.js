		#Welcome to plants!
		Plants is an idling game built into Aeiou to help you grow a flower.
		To begin, you need to collect a seed. This can be done with <!dig> every few hours, or by reacting to messages with 'ðŸŒ°' when Aeiou does every so often.
		Once you've collected a seed, you can view it with <!seeds>.

		Now, plant your seed with <!plant [seed number]>, water your plant (or your friends!) with <!water>, and wait for it to grow!
		Once it's fully grown, you can harvest it with <!harvest>.

		See the full list of commands avilable with <!help>, under "Plant commands".

	gangs: stripIndents`\`\`\`md
	#Welcome to gangs!
	Gangs is a game all about trust. Create a gang using <gang new [name]>, and use <gang code> to get it's invite code.
	Give this code to your friends, and they can join it using <gang join [code]>.
	While you're at it, you can customize your gang with <gang title>, <gang desc>, <gang color>, and <gang pic>.

	Be careful, as anyone you invite to your gang can betray you, destroying your whole gang with <gang betray>.
	Choose to either build a large gang, or attempt to betray the largest gang you can.
